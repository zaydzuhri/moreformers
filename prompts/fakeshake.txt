JULIA 
My dearest Leon, how I longed to see thy face And hear thy voice, 
that doth enchant my ears. 
But tell me, love, how didst thou scape thy place And come to me, 
despite thy father’s fears?

LEON 
My sweetest Julia, thou art worth the risk Of angry words and threats of banishment. 
I climbed the wall that parts our houses brisk And found thee here, 
by moonlight’s guidance sent.

JULIA 
Oh, how I wish that we could live in peace And not be subject to our parents’ hate. 
Why must we suffer for their old caprice And hide our love, as if it were a bait?

LEON 
Fear not, my love, for we shall find a way To end this strife and make our joy complete. 
I have a friend, a friar old and gray Who knows a secret that can cheat our fate.

JULIA 
What secret, pray, can help us in our need? And what can friar do to ease our woe?
