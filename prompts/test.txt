They are the hope of the forest
The promise of a greener future
They sprout from the seeds of their elders
And grow with the help of the sun and rain
They face many challenges and dangers
The drought, the fire, the storm, the axe
But they are resilient and adaptable
They bend, they heal, they thrive, they survive
They are the beauty of the landscape
The source of oxygen and shade
They provide food and shelter for many creatures
And enrich the soil with their leaves
They are the saplings of the earth
The children of nature's grace
They deserve our respect and protection
And our gratitude for their gifts
